# Birthing Locations in the US: An In Depth Look Into Freestanding Birth Centers and Hospitals 2010-2020

# Motivation:
When I moved to Cleveland, OH I was surprised at the lack of alternate birth options to hospital births. I had coached a friend through two beautiful natural births in a small birth center and had dreams that when it was my turn, I would also birth in the comfort of a not hospital yet safe place.
When I became pregnant with my first child, I looked into other options rather than birthing in a hospital but was dismayed that those options did not exist in Cleveland. Therefore, I wanted to see if there were better birth outcomes in a free standing birth center or a hospital and the general breakdown of who is most likely to choose a birth center over a hospital. In order to deepen the analysis, I compared national trends to those in Ohio.
For this project, average APGAR scores as well as whether there had been any or no complications during labor or birth were used to determine whether outcomes were better in the hospital or birth center. A further breakdown of birth rate trends within Age and Education of Mother were used in order to deepen the analysis. Lastly, an analysis of those mother's who choose a birth center over hospital was done in order to see if there were any major disparities.

# Technologies:
The technologies used were Python, Tableau and Excel.
Python was used within a Jupyter Notebook in order to read the national CSV's as well as to limit the number of columns and do some general data cleaning.
Excel was used in order to do some basic data cleaning for the Ohio data.
Tableau was used for analysis and creating the final dashboard.

# Challenges
The data chosen was incredibly large and took a few trials in order to figure out how to be able to open and read it. As stated before I used Python in order to bring in the CSV using only certain columns. One of the hurdles I ran into was data types not being the same across years, and therefore needing to do some conversion so I was able to analyze across all 10 years.
One of the biggest hurdles was knowing that my data would be skewed given the following factors:
  -Not all women have access to birth centers (location, payment coverage etc....)
  -Birth center's typically only deliver women considered "low risk" and with a maximum age of 35
  -Some women cannot birth naturally and therefore need to be in a hospital setting

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by my own birth experiences as well as listening to birth stories from friends and family.
Many thanks to my instructors and fellow DDA6 cohort apprentices at Nashville Software School for pushing and challenging me in so many ways to foster my growth.
