# Capstone_Project
Collect all data from CDC website using Python
Only collect columns needed (13 out of 224)
Convert data types so all data the same(floats to int)
convert int to all same format (use for Loop and divide by 10)
for loop took too long (going to merge, group and then rename for better efficiency)
need to add a column for year to each csv in prep for merge
combine birth center and hospital birth tables together and re-export as csv
-need to normalize data so can compare accross Race
stumbled onto some cool trends with regards to complications and Apgar scores comparing with payment types
